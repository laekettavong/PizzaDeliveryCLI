# PizzaDeliveryCLI

This is the frontend for (continuation of) [PizzaDeliveryAPI](https://github.com/laekettavong/PizzaDeliveryAPI). With the frontend, a user can browse the menu of a fictious pizzia, create an account, login, add menu items to a shopping cart, and place an order. Once the order is placed, the users card is charged and an email reciept is sent to the out.
